##Liri Node Project

#Purpose of This Project
The main point of this project was to create a program, run in the terminal, that would allow users
to search for information about a movie, look up songs details via Spotify, or find out when a band 
would be having a show near you.

#Troubles With This One
I'm going to assume, like most of these projects, I got over 90% of the code correct; unfortunately,
in coding, even 99.9% isn't good enough. So while the code will be mostly correct, a few glaring errors
caused my application to not function as it would.

The main issue I ran in to was in line 28 of the "liri.js" file, it said that "spotify.search" was not 
a function. After a furious practice of Googlefu, I was unable to find out exactly what I did.

The bands and movie sections, let's just say, it isn't working, and I couldn't begin to tell you why.

#Conclusion
I've learned a lot from this lesson, and if I had given myself more time, I'm sure I would have figured
out exactly what my problems were. Alas, that was not meant to be this time.
